I've just finished setting up my _brand new_ portfolio site.

Well "finished" might be a strong word, I'll definitely keep tweaking things and adding features as I go. But it's live and ready for content!

This is where I'll be posting articles about topics I'm working on or find interesting. Expect posts about UEFI, reverse engineering, cybersecurity, and general programming stuff. Basically whatever I'm diving into at the time.

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the awesome [Terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) which I think looks quite cool!
