# About

Driven by curiosity and precision, I'm deeply passionate about low-level cybersecurity, from MDM systems to obfuscation and DRM. I started exploring security at 11, dissecting how systems protect (and sometimes fail to protect) what lies beneath the surface.

I aim to pursue a Master II through a [*Grande École*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole) pathway after preparatory classes (MP2I/MPSI), and eventually contribute to high-impact security research and development.
